            We at Humaniti have been working hard to put an end to this. Every
            human being on the planet deserves access to clean water and basic
            sanitation, which we take for granted. Humanitiâ€™s NGO partners are
            on the ground to give access to those who don't have clean drinking
            water. We provide support by building wells & water pumps,
            distributing water tanks, & more.
